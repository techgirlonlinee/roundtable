				<h1>SAYOMBHU MUKDEEPROM</h1>
				<p class="info">
	  				Best known for his work on the films of Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Sayombhu Mukdeeprom has been spreading his wings internationally, shooting acclaimed films such as Miguel Gomes’ Arabian Nights and Luca Guadagnino’s two most recent features, Suspiria and Call Me By Your Name, for which he won back to back Best Cinematography Awards at the Independent Spirit Awards in 2017 and 2018.

				<h1>PHUTTIPONG AROONPHENG </h1>
				<p class="info">
	  				At the 2018 Venice Film Festival, Phuttipong Aroonpheng’s first feature Manta Ray received the Orizzonti Awards Prize, the first time a Thai film was ever bestowed with that honor. The film continues to travel and receive praise from all corners of the world. This Spotlight will take a look at Aroonpheng’s 8-year journey of making this film a reality, starting from its initial conception, to finding collaborators, facing roadblocks, and making the short Ferris Wheel, which ultimately led to the feature film in its final form.
