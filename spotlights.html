					Over the past decade there is no denying that GDH (and its predecessor GTH) have become the gold standard for commercial film production in Thailand.  From early hits such as <span>Bangkok Love Story</span> and <span>Hello Stranger</span> to international blockbusters <span>Pee Mak</span> and <span>Bad Genius</span>, the release of every new GDH film is an event. This Spotlight will go behind the scenes of the studio's creative process and brand building with Jira Maligool and  Vanridee Pongsittisak, the studio’s two lead producers.

	  				At the 2018 Venice Film Festival, Phuttipong Aroonpheng’s first feature Manta Ray received the Orizzonti Awards Prize, the first time a Thai film was ever bestowed with that honor. The film continues to travel and receive praise from all corners of the world. This Spotlight will take a look at Aroonpheng’s 8-year journey of making this film a reality, starting from its initial conception, to finding collaborators, facing roadblocks, and making the short <span>Ferris Wheel</span>, which ultimately led to the feature film in its final form.</p>
