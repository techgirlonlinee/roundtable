				<p class="info">
	  				At the 2018 Venice Film Festival, Phuttipong Aroonpheng’s first feature Manta Ray received the Orizzonti Awards Prize, the first time a Thai film was ever bestowed with that honor. The film continues to travel and receive praise from all corners of the world. This Spotlight will take a look at Aroonpheng’s 8-year journey of making this film a reality, starting from its initial conception, to finding collaborators, facing roadblocks, and making the short Ferris Wheel, which ultimately led to the feature film in its final form.
