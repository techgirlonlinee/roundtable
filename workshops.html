			<h1>48-HOUR FILM CHALLENGE</h1>
			<p>
			Often, films tend to take a long time and cost a lot of money to make. The 48-Hour Film Challenge will force you to break these “rules” and work quickly and instinctually, the same as painting a picture or playing a guitar. Participants will meet on Thursday, July 4, 2019 for a talk by mentors Nottapon Boonprakob and xxxxxxxx, and receive the prompt. They will then have 48 hours to write, shoot, and edit their three-minute film to turn in by Saturday, July 6, 2019. Finally, all the films will be screened together for the public on Sunday, July 7, 2019. Prizes will be awarded by a jury. This workshop is limited to 35 participants (can be teams).

			<h2>UNDERSTANDING FILM CRITICISM</h2>
			<p>
			Contrary to popular belief, the role of the film critic is not to encourage people to like or dislike a film but simply to look more closely at the artistry before making up their mind. This workshop, led by mentors Prawit Taengaksorn and Graiwoot Chulapongsathorn, will cover critical perspectives in watching films and skills in organizing and writing your feelings down on paper. Participants will meet in two 3-hour sessions, the first on Thursday July 4, 2019 and the second on Sunday, July 7, 2019. In between, there will also be a film screening held in conjunction with the Bangkok ASEAN Film Festival. This workshop is limited to 10 participants.

			<h3>THE WORK OF THE FILM PRODUCER</h3>
			<p>
			There is never any doubt in people’s minds what a film director does, but it’s often a mystery what a film producer does, even by people who are already working in the film industry. And yet, no film can be made without a producer. This workshop, led by mentors Pimpaka Towira and Soros Sukhum, will shed light on the work of the producer and give participants an understanding of how to become one. The topics covered will include financing, budgeting, production, distribution, and exhibition. Participants will meet in two 3-hour sessions, the first on Friday, July 5, 2019, and the second on Sunday, July 7, 2019. This workshop is limited to 20 participants.
