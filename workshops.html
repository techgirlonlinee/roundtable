		Films tend to take a long time and cost a lot of money to make. The 48-Hour Film Challenge will force you to depart from this paradigm and work quickly and instinctually. Participants will meet on Thursday, July 4th for a talk by mentors Nottapon Boonprakob and Thitipong Kerdtongtawee, and receive the prompt to begin the challenge. They will then have 48 hours to write, shoot, and edit their three-minute film by Saturday, July 6th. All the films will be screened together for the public on Sunday, July 7th, where prizes will be awarded by the mentors. The winners will receive cash prizes of 20,000 THB (First Prize), 10,000 THB (Second Prize) and 5,000 THB (Third Prize).

		<p class="main">
		Contrary to popular belief, the role of the film critic is not to encourage people to like or dislike a film but simply to look more closely at the artistry before making up their mind. This workshop, led by mentors Prawit Taengaksorn and Graiwoot Chulapongsathorn, will cover critical perspectives in watching films and skills in organizing and writing your thoughts. Participants will meet in two 3-hour sessions, the first on Thursday July 4th and the second on Sunday, July 7th. In between, participants will attend film screenings held in conjunction with the Bangkok ASEAN Film Festival and meet with the directors of the films for interviews and further discussions.

		While most understand the role of a film director, the role of a film producer is often shrouded in mystery. This lack of awareness extends even to film professionals, and yet no film can be made without a producer. This workshop, led by mentors Pimpaka Towira and Soros Sukhum, will shed light on the work of the producer and give participants an understanding of how to become one. The topics covered will include financing, budgeting, production, distribution, and exhibition. Participants will meet in two 3-hour sessions, the first on Friday, July 5th, and the second on Sunday, July 7th.
