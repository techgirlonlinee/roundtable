			<h3>FEMALE CINEMATOGRAPHERS</h3>
			<p>
			Often, films tend to take a long time and cost a lot of money to make. The 48-Hour Film Challenge will force you to break these “rules” and work quickly and instinctually, the same as painting a picture or playing a guitar. Participants will meet on Thursday, July 4, 2019 for a talk by mentors Nottapon Boonprakob and xxxxxxxx, and receive the prompt. They will then have 48 hours to write, shoot, and edit their three-minute film to turn in by Saturday, July 6, 2019. Finally, all the films will be screened together for the public on Sunday, July 7, 2019. Prizes will be awarded by a jury. This workshop is limited to 35 participants (can be teams).
